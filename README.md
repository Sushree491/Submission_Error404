# Submission_Error404
This repository is submission by team Error404 for Ecohacks 2022 Hackathon.
Due to time constraints we could not develop the complete prototype of the application. But we have built the wireframe to describe the features of the app.
We have included a presentation and a video which describes the complete working of the app along with its features.
This app mainly focuses on a fun way to make people realize what our mother Earth in going through.
